### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you don't share code._
_Please include any people or other sources who helped you, and any students whom you helped._
_For each source, make sure to include how they helped you (or how you helped them)._ [1 point]

_Here are some example citations:_

* _"I had no idea how to approach Question 3 until classmate Husky Huskington explained how I could
  break it down into
  separate functions."_
* _"Joseph Aoun and I bounced ideas off each other for Question 4, although we both did our own
  coding."_

_If you did not talk to anybody about the assignment (which would be surprising), please state
that._

I worked with Douglas Conrad as a pair programmer.

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you used and what your
prompts were. Your
assignment will not be graded if you do not answer this question._ [1 point]

_Here is an example citation:_

* _"I didn't remember how to convert a string to an int, so I asked Google Bard. It also showed me
  how to handle an
  exception if the string couldn't be converted."_

No AI was used for this assignment.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which ones were particularly
helpful._ [1 point]

We used lecture slides from class. Additionally, I used notes I took back in high school during AP
CSA, which helped me
with the syntax of lists. We also
used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-random-numbers-in-java/ for implementing
Random.

## Logstics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass._ [1 point]

Yes.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._ [1 point]

1.5 hours.

### Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are
always
welcome._ [4 points]

The most difficult part of the assignment was transitioning back to Java from Kotlin, and relearning
much of the syntax.
The most rewarding part of
the assignment was implementing the step() function and seeing our code work for the first time. We
learned new Java
syntax
doing this assignment, as well as how to code with displays.
