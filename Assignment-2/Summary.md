I used my AP CSA notes for the getCurrentStrength() method with Math.ceil and autoboxing/unboxing (I'm forgetting the
correct term, I know it's one of those though for a fact) double to int.

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, and does everything work? [1 point]

_Either answer "Yes" or describe what you were not able to complete or
what tests did not pass._

## Reflections [3 points]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was creating the attack() method because of the multitude of different cases
and attributes it wanted. The most rewarding part of the assignment was seeing the tests pass. I got refreshed on
autoboxing and
unboxing, and I got more familiar with Java syntax.
