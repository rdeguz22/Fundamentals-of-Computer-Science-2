I just used my prior notes from AP CSA. I went back to my notes on loops for this assignment. It really helped me

My tests did cover every line of rollDice() and the buildTable() methods to the best of my ability. I submitted some

if at all. Suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are

share it._

This assignment is one of the toughest ones I have done so far in college. This was actually the first difficult
test driven development assignment that I can recall. I learned more about the process of test driven development
and find it a useful, yet difficult way of approaching an assignment. This assignment was definitely some good reps
with for loops and if statements. Definitely a lot more work to do on my own in this class.
