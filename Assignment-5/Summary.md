## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested? [1 point]

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._

Yes, I successfully implemented everything that was requested.

## How long did the assignment take? [1 point]

_Provide the number of hours or minutes. Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure,
give the average of the range so we can enter the estimate in a spreadsheet._

This assignment took around 3 hours.

## Who did you work with and how? [1 point]

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours. We especially
like hearing about helpful TAs._

Pair Progamming with Ricardo de Guzman and Douglas Conrad. I did not attend office hours.

## What was your AI usage? [1 point]

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

I used AI to find out how to read text from a URL in Java as per the instructions of
"You may use ChatGPT and other online resources to find out how to do something in Java." to
figure out how to collect the content of a poem for my Poem class that I created as an addition.

## What other resources did you use? [1 point]

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. You do not need to list course materials._

Some other resources I used were https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29943128/reliance-on-default-encoding to fix the
second SpotBug,
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12405159/how-to-get-data-from-a-url, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html,
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16265693/how-to-use-bufferedreader-in-java to help me understand
how to read from a url for the poem content.

## What was your addition? [1 point]

_Please describe the behavior and data set._

My addition was creating the Poem class, PoemGuiLauncher, and PoemTests. The Poem class takes in a
title and URL, where it reads the title and collects the content of the poem from the URL. In the PoemTest class,
I test increasing and decreasing titles and increasing poem title length.

## Reflections [3 points]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome, as is feedback about TAs._

The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing. There was a lot of implementing that
needed to be done in order to complete this assignment. The most rewarding part of this assignment is
being able to say I can understand what each class is doing. From this assignment, I learned more about
classes (extending vs implementing), GUI, and implementation.
