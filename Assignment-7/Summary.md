# SUMMARY

Please read and follow the assignment instructions on Canvas. Please put your answers
here after the italicized instructions (indicated by underscores).

## What are the GitHub team name, user names, and repository URL? [1 point]

_We need this information to grade your assignment._

Github team name: homework-7-doug-rico
Team members: rdeguz22 & dougconrad.
repository URL: https://github.com/Fundies-2-Oakland/homework-7-doug-rico.git

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested? [1 point]

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._

Yes I implemented everything to the best of my ability.

## How long do you estimate the assignment took? [1 point]

_Estimate the number of hours or minutes. Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure,
give the average of the range so we can enter the estimate in a spreadsheet._

This assignment took around 3 hours.

## Who did you work with and how? [1 point]

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours. We especially
like hearing about helpful TAs._

Pair Progamming with Ricardo de Guzman and Douglas Conrad. I did not attend office hours.

## What was your AI usage? [1 point]

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

I only used AI to gain a better understanding on sets and hashsets. I used the prompt "Explain what hashsets are in
great detail and give examples. It helped me gain a deeper understanding and visualization of it
and was very helpful in completing this assignment.

## What other resources did you use? [1 point]

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. You do not need to list course materials._

I used the class slides and previous notes from my time in high school taking AP CSA.

## Reflections [4 points]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome, as is feedback about TAs. If you implemented
extra milestones, say so here._

The most difficult part of the assignment was conceptually creating the functions. There was a lot of critical
thinking and writing it out on paper to complete this assignment. The most rewarding part of the assignment was
being able to visually see it work and test it with multiple puzzles and words. I learned more about sets, hashsets,
and more about the difference between sets and lists and when to apply which.
