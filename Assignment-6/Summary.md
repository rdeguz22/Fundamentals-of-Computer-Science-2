# SUMMARY

Please read and follow the assignment instructions on Canvas. Please put your answers
here after the italicized instructions (indicated by underscores).

## What are the GitHub team name, user names, and repository URL? [1 point]

_We need this information to grade your assignment._

Github team name: homework-5-meows-in-a-gui-rico-doug-2,
user names: rdequz22 & dougconrad,
repository URL: https://github.com/Fundies-2-Oakland/homework-6-rico-doug-3.git

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested? [1 point]

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._

Yes I implemented everything that was requested to the best of my ability.

## How long did the assignment take? [1 point]

_Estimate the number of hours or minutes. Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure,
give the average of the range so we can enter the estimate in a spreadsheet._

This assignment took around 3 hours.

## Who did you work with and how? [1 point]

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours. We especially
like hearing about helpful TAs._

Pair Progamming with Ricardo de Guzman and Douglas Conrad. I did not attend office hours.

## What was your AI usage? [1 point]

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

I only used AI to further explain the Linked List. I used the prompt "Explain what a linked list is in deep detail".
It helped me get a clearer understanding of visualizing it.

## What other resources did you use? [1 point]

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. You do not need to list course materials._

I used the class slides and previous notes from my time in high school taking AP CSA. I also used Piazza
to help with submission. I submitted multiple times because the first two submissions I thought were bugs with the
autograder, but then I looked at Piazza and realized I needed another constructor for LinkedListRingBuffer and
ArrayListRingBuffer
that takes in two parameters. The rest of the submissions were just trying to get a higher score
in the autograder and fixing after rereading the instruction. Piazza really helped me figure out what I needed to do for
the autograder.

## Reflections [4 points]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome, as is feedback about TAs._

The most difficult part of this program was the magnitude in classes that were required to be made
in order to complete this assignment. Also, figuring out the tests gave some difficulty. The most rewarding
part of this assignment was seeing all the tests pass and being able to hear audio proving the code works.
I learned more about implementing interfaces and using subclasses. Additionally getting in more practice with
tests taught me a lot. Going forward I definitely need to pay closer attention to the instructions.
